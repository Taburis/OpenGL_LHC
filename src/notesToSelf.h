/*
try to get pythia initialization faster and also multiple different types of processes

working on getting particles going down beamline
Need to render the extra alpha detail in the beamline shader based on the time gotten in beam::Update()

Also need to interface Beam with Event class so the Event class can know what a event happens for syncronization

Add more ways to control the pileup
